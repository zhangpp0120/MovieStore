@model List<Movie>
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "index";

<h1>List of Top Movies @ViewBag.MoviesCount</h1>
@ViewData["myname"]

@*we need to tell our View whats the data it is receiving*@
@*in this case its receiving List of Movies*@
@*I wanna use HTML table or HTMl UL*@
@*Razor Views combine C# with HTML and they are very powerful and Developer friendly*@
@*1. Place @model on top of the view with the expecting data type
    2. We can access the actual data using Model (ASP.NET) alias for @model*@

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <td>Id</td>
        <td>Title</td>
        <td>Budget</td>
    </tr>
    @foreach (var movie in Model)
    {
        <tr>
            <td>@movie.Id</td>
            <td>@movie.Title</td>
            <td>@movie.Budget</td>

        </tr>
    }
