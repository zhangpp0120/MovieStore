we need to make Ajax calls from Anglualr to  API to get data.
XMLHttpRequest   js
HttpClient(angular)-> it will use XMLHttpRequest behind the scenes (XHR)

asp.net --> controller(MVC and API) --> service (class libraries) --> Repositories(class libaries) --> database
we usually separate our angular application code into different feature folders to organize and reuse our code properly

angular -> components -> services(resuealbe) -> HttpClient -> API (JSON)
--> services will get that to components and components will return model to the views, so that views can display that data.

we create a base API service that will have common CRUD operations () so that specific services MovieService, GenreService etc can talk to API 

A service is nothing but a TypeScript class that has @jnjectable decorator, so that we can use it with DI.
