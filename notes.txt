we need to make Ajax calls from Anglualr to  API to get data.
XMLHttpRequest   js
HttpClient(angular)-> it will use XMLHttpRequest behind the scenes (XHR)

asp.net --> controller(MVC and API) --> service (class libraries) --> Repositories(class libaries) --> database
we usually separate our angular application code into different feature folders to organize and reuse our code properly

angular -> components -> services(resuealbe) -> HttpClient -> API (JSON)
--> services will get that to components and components will return model to the views, so that views can display that data.

we create a base API service that will have common CRUD operations () so that specific services MovieService, GenreService etc can talk to API 

A service is nothing but a TypeScript class that has @jnjectable decorator, so that we can use it with DI. 

In bootstarp there are certain components that have dependency on other 3rd party JS libraries such as jQuery etc...
But when we install boostrap in angular we dont wanna install jQuery or other 3rd party libarraies because they might have conflict with Angular and they might effect how DOM works
properly
Some of the components from Boostrap don't work bt default such as dropdowns, Caraousels, etc.....
for those components there are 2 very popular angular verision of librraies
ngBootstarp -- they craeted those componnets purely based on angular , they dont require jquery or other 3rd party libarraies
ngXBoostrap

<!-- for navigation/ routing in angular instead of using href, we use angular Router -->
